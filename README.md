Fundraising App

**DO NOT WORK DIRECTLY IN MASTER**
Please checkout a new branch to do any work on this project before we merge.

Important Notes for iOS App:
Due to the use of CocoaPods for Facebook and Google integration, opening the project
in Xcode requires opening the .xcworkspace file, and NOT the .xcodeproj file. Opening the
.xcodeproj file will result in numerous compilation errors. Close the project and reopen
using the .xcworkspace file.
